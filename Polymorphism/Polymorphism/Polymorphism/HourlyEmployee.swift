// YOU CAN EXTEND THE HIERARCHY..meaning is you can add more classes.
// INheritance is basically creating new classes from the existing class
// They facilitates the code reusability
// If any member is private then it can not be inherited.

    public var hourlyRate: Double = 0.0
    public var numberofHoursWorked: Double = 0.0
    // earnings will rate multiplied by hours..
